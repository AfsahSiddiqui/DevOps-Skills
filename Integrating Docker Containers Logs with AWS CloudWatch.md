# Integrating Docker Container Logs with AWS CloudWatch

### Benefits

- Collect logs from multiple containers across multiple hosts in one place; easier to monitor, debug, and audit
- Use CloudWatch Logs Insights to query logs with SQL-like syntax; find errors or patterns across containers quickly
- Set up CloudWatch Alarms on specific log patterns (e.g., "error", "500", etc.); get alerts via email, SNS, or Lambda triggers
- Fine-grained IAM policies to control who can view or modify logs; full integration with AWS Identity & Access Management (IAM)
